            **CLIENT ASSESSMENT REPORT**
            
            Begin with a title:
            "Client Assessment Report for ${firstName}
            Prepared by DreamScape AI"

            Start with a warm, professional introduction that explains this assessment is based on evidence-based psychological frameworks for personal transformation. Make it clear this is more than a reflection but a revelation of patterns and opportunities.

            For each question, structure your response like this:
            1. "Client Response:" - include the exact text the client provided
            2. "DreamScape AI Insight:" - provide personalized analysis showing deep understanding of the client's situation, patterns, and potential

            After addressing all questions, include these two important sections:

            First section titled "üí° What the Neuro Change Method‚Ñ¢ Can Do for You"
            Explain how the Neuro Change Method specifically addresses the client's unique challenges revealed in their assessment, highlighting these components:
            - Self-Concordance Mapping - connecting desires to deeper values
            - Automaticity Training - rewiring automatic thoughts and behaviors
            - Belief Engineering - reconstructing limiting beliefs
            - Purpose Integration Protocols - aligning actions with purpose
            - Flow State Activation - accessing peak mental performance

            Final section titled "üíé Why Now, Why You, and Why a Neuro Change Practitioner?"
            Provide compelling, personalized reasons why this is the ideal time for the client to take action, explaining how working with a certified practitioner can help them achieve their specific goals faster, with a warm invitation to book a discovery session.

            **PRACTITIONER CASE REPORT**
            
            Begin with the title:
            "üß≠ Practitioner Case Report: ${firstName}"

            Then include these sections in order:

            1. "Client Summary" - A comprehensive overview of presenting issues, psychological patterns, and key observations from all responses

            2. "Primary Objective:" - A single clear goal statement based on assessment responses

            3. "Key Barriers:" - A bulleted list (‚óè) of 3-5 specific psychological/emotional obstacles identified

            4. "Transformation Theme:" - A one-line statement capturing the essence of the client's journey

            5. "Neuro Change Method‚Ñ¢: Your 4-Phase Transformation Journey"
               Include these four phases with specific focus areas, tools, and expected outcomes for this client:
               - üß† Phase 1: Consciousness (weeks 1-3)
               - üß† Phase 2: Mindset & Neuroplasticity (weeks 4-6)
               - üß† Phase 3: Subconscious Reprogramming (weeks 7-9)
               - üß† Phase 4: Permanent Integration (weeks 10-12)

            6. "12-Week Milestone Map" - Create a table with these columns:
               Milestone | Target Week | Tools & Focus
               Include 6 specific, measurable milestones spread across the 12-week program

            7. "Projected Transformation Outcomes" - A bulleted list (‚óè) of 4-6 specific, measurable outcomes the client can expect

            8. End with a powerful closing statement about the client's potential for transformation

            9. "Practitioner Notes" - Include assessment of client temperament, communication style, and best practices for working with this specific client

            FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
            - Maintain professional, warm, and empathetic language throughout
            - Ensure proper formatting with clear section headers
            - Balance being direct about challenges while maintaining an empowering tone
            - Use bullet points (‚óè) for lists
            - Separate the two reports with "---DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR---"

            Both reports should feel deeply personalized to the client's specific situation, not generic. The client should feel understood, and the practitioner should receive actionable clinical insights.
